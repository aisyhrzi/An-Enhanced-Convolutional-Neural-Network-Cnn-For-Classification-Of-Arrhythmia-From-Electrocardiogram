1. Collect ECG signals, focusing on .csv files
I selected and collected ECG signals in .csv format from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database for further processing.

2. Extract the MLII column
For each ECG file, I focused on extracting the MLII (Modified Lead II) channel, which provides a clear signal for arrhythmia analysis.
