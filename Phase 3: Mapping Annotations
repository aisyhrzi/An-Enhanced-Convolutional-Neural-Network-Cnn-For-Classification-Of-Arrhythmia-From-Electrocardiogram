What This Code Does – Annotation Mapping

1. Beat Class Definition
A function (get_beat_class) groups MIT-BIH annotation symbols into five classes according to the AAMI standard:

0: Normal (N, L, R, e, j)

1: Supraventricular (S, A, J, a)

2: Ventricular (V, E)

3: Fusion (F)

4: Unknown (/, f, Q)

2. Annotation File Processing

For each ECG record, the corresponding annotation file (.txt) is read. This file provides the sample indices and the original beat types. The function converts each original beat label to a numeric class label.

3. Segment Label Assignment
Each denoised, segmented ECG file is loaded. For every segment (of 1000 samples), the corresponding annotations are identified based on sample index. The most frequent class label (mode) within each segment is assigned as the segment’s label. If no annotation exists for a segment, the label is set to -1.

4. Saving Labeled Data
The segment labels are added as a new column to the data. The labeled, denoised, and segmented data are then saved as new CSV files. For each file, a summary table of segment counts per class is printed.

5. Total Class Count Across All Files
The script maintains a total count of each class label across all files and prints a summary table at the end.
